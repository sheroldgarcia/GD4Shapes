# Description

**GD4Shapes** allows obtaining the geodesic distance between shapes by considering a fixed parameterization of these shapes, which takes into account their alignment under certain conditions. This approach speeds up the calculation of the distance and significantly reduces computational costs, since the entire iterative process involved in obtaining the geodesic distance by considering all the reparameterizations of one of the shapes is eliminated.
